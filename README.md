# KnightOfCards
A text-based Card Game, based on the famous 52-count deck of cards, where each card has it's own ability, and each suit has it's own hero!

Game is currently in Development. 12 cards available, 4 heroes. More features soon!

Just like my [Python RPG](https://github.com/crawsome/pyrpg_mini) the plans here are to simulate, and to let others simlulate their own card games.
